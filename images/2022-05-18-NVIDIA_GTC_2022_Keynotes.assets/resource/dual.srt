00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:25,800
FourCastNet is a physics-informed deep learning model
that can predict weather events such as hurricanes,

169
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
大气河以及极端降水等天气事件

170
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
atmospheric rivers, and extreme rain.

171
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,800
FourCastNet 以欧洲中期天气预报中心 (ECMWF) 长达 40 年的模拟增强型真值数据为基础

172
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,800
FourCastNet learned to predict weather from 40 years of simulation-enhanced ground truth data from ECMWF,

173
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,400
学会了如何预测天气

174
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,400
the European Center of Medium Weather Forecasting.

175
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,700
深度学习模型首次在降水预测方面达到了比先进的数值模型更高的准确率和技能

176
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,733
For the first time, a deep learning model has achieved better accuracy and skill on precipitation forecasting

177
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:58,100
并使预测速度提高了 4 到 5 个数量级

178
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:58,133
than state-of-the-art numerical models,
and makes predictions 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster -

179
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,100
也就是说传统的数值模拟需要一年的时间，而现在只需要几分钟

180
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:03,100
what takes a classical numerical
simulation a year now take minutes.

181
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:11,200
大气河是天空中巨大的水汽河流，每条河流的水量都比亚马逊河的还要多

182
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:11,200
Atmospheric rivers are enormous rivers of water vapor in the sky – each carrying more water than the Amazon.

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,000
它们一方面为美国西部提供了关键的降水来源，但另一方面，这些巨大的强风暴也会导致

184
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,033
They provide a key source of precipitation for the western U.S., but these large, powerful storms can also cause

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,300
灾难性的洪灾和暴雪

186
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,333
catastrophic flooding and massive snowfalls.

187
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,300
NVIDIA 创建了 Physics-ML 模型，该模型可以模拟全球天气模式的动态变化

188
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:28,300
NVIDIA has created a physics-ML model that
emulates the dynamics of global weather patterns

189
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:35,400

190
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:35,433
and predicts extreme weather events, like atmospheric rivers, with unprecedented speed and accuracy.

191
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:43,100
此 GPU 加速的 AI 数字孪生模型名为 FourCastNet，由傅里叶神经算子提供动力支持

192
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:43,133
Powered by the Fourier Neural Operator, this GPU-accelerated AI-enabled digital twin, called FourCastNet,

193
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,800
基于 10 TB 的地球系统数据进行训练

194
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,800
is trained on 10 TB of Earth system data.

195
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,900
依托这些数据，以及 NVIDIA Modulus 和 Omniverse，我们能够提前一周预测

196
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,933
Using this data, together with NVIDIA Modulus and Omniverse, we are able to forecast the precise path

197
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,400
灾难性大气河的精确路线

198
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:58,400
of catastrophic atmospheric rivers a full week in advance.

199
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,700
在一个 NVIDIA GPU 的助力下，FourCastNet 只需几分之一秒即可完成预测

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,700
FourCastNet takes only a fraction of a
second on a single NVIDIA GPU.

201
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,900
凭借如此快的速度，我们可以生成数千个模拟场景，探索所有可能的结果

202
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,933
With such enormous speed, we can generate thousands of simulations, to explore all possible outcomes.

203
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:18,000
与以往相比，我们能够更加自信地量化灾难性洪灾的风险

204
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:18,033
Allowing us to quantify the risk of catastrophic flooding with greater confidence than was ever possible before.

205
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,700
NVIDIA 是加速计算的先驱，这个领域需要全栈专业知识

206
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,700
NVIDIA is pioneering accelerated computing,
an approach that demands full-stack expertise.

207
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,200
类似于一个计算堆栈或神经网络，我们从四个层级来构建 NVIDIA：

208
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,200
We built NVIDIA like a computing stack,
a neural network – in four layers –

209
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,900
硬件、系统软件、平台软件和应用

210
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,900
hardware, system software, platform software, and applications.

211
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,300
每一层都对计算机制造商、服务提供商和开发者开放

212
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,300
Each layer is open to computer makers,
service providers, and developers

213
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,800
让他们以更适合的方式集成到其产品当中

214
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,800
to integrate into their offering however best for them.

215
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,200
今天，我将在每一层级都宣布对应的新产品

216
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,200
I will announce new products at each of these layers today.

217
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,500
让我们开始吧

218
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,533
Let's get started.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
AI 的进步令人惊叹

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
The progress of AI is stunning.

221
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Transformer 模型开启了自监督学习，并解除了人工标记数据的需求

222
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Transformers opened self-supervised learning
and unblocked the need for human-labeled data.

223
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,400
因此我们可以使用庞大的训练集来训练 Transformer 模型

224
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,400
We can use enormous training sets with Transformers

225
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,400
学习更充分且可靠的特征

226
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,400
and learn more robust
and more complete representations.

227
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,500
得益于 Transformer，模型和数据的规模皆已扩大增长，而模型技能和准确性也因此快速提升

228
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,533
Because of Transformers, model and data size grew,
and model skills and accuracy took off.

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,500
用于语言理解的 Google BERT，用于药物研发的 NVIDIA MegaMolBart，以及 DeepMind 的 AlphaFold

230
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:24,500
Google BERT for language understanding, NVIDIA MegaMolBart for drug discovery, and DeepMind AlphaFold

231
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,400
都是基于 Transformer 模型的突破性成果

232
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,433
are all breakthroughs traced to Transformers.

233
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:34,700
Transformer 让自监督学习成为可能，也令 AI 飞速发展

234
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:34,700
Transformers made self-supervised learning possible,
and AI jumped to warp speed.

235
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,300
自然语言理解模型可以从大量的文本中学习，无需监督

236
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,300
Natural language understanding models can learn without supervision from vast amounts of text,

237
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,400
然后通过少量的人工标记数据来进行细化

238
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,433
which is then refined with a small
amount of human-labeled data

239
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:55,900
以发展其在翻译、问答、摘要、写作等方面的优秀技能

240
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:55,933
to develop good skills for translation,
Q&A, summarization, writing, and so much more.

241
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:03,300
具备语言监督的多模态学习已为计算机视觉开拓了新维度

242
00:13:55,933 --> 00:14:03,333
Multi-model learning with language supervision has
added another dimension to computer vision.

243
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:11,500
像 NVIDIA NVCell 这样的强化学习模型正在执行芯片布局，其也就表示 AI 正在构建芯片

244
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:11,533
Reinforcement learning models, like NVIDIA NVCell,
are doing chip layout – AI is building chips.

245
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,600
如同 FourCastNet 和 Orbnet，Physics-ML 模型也正在学习物理学和量子物理学

246
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:18,633
Like FourCastNet and Orbnet, physics-ML models
are learning physics and quantum physics.

247
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,000
这些是取得重大科学突破的首要条件

248
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:23,033
The conditions are prime for
significant breakthroughs in science.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
生成模型正在改变创意设计、帮助构建虚拟世界

250
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:28,000
Generative Models are transforming
 creative design, helping build virtual worlds,

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,300
并将革新通信方式

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,300
and soon, revolutionizing communications.

253
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,800
如同 NeRF，从 2D 图像中学习 3D 表征的神经图形网络

254
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,800
Like Nerf, Neural Graphics networks that learn 3D representations from 2D images

255
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,500
将扩大摄影应用场景，并帮助我们创造属于我们世界的数字孪生

256
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,500
will elevate photography and help us
create digital twins of our world.

257
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:52,700
AI 正在各个方向加速发展，包括新的架构、新的学习策略、更大和更可靠的模型

258
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:52,700
AI is racing in every direction – new architectures,
new learning strategies, larger and more robust models,

259
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,400
新的科学、新的应用、新的行业，所有这些都在同时进行

260
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,400
 new science, new applications, new industries
– all at the same time.

261
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
接下来我展示一个令人惊叹的示例

262
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,233
Here’s an amazing example.

263
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,600
这个 AI 驱动的动画角色是基于物理规则的强化学习模型制作的

264
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:06,600
This AI-powered character is animated using a
physics-based reinforcement learning model.

265
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
一起来看一下

266
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
Let’s take a look.

267
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:16,600
我们正在利用强化学习开发更加栩栩如生、反应灵敏的物理模拟角色

268
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:16,600
We are using reinforcement learning to develop more life-like and responsive physically simulated characters.

269
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,300
我们的角色通过模仿人类的动作数据，来学习执行逼真的动作

270
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,333
Our character learns to perform life-like motions
by imitating human motion data,

271
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,600
例如行走、跑动和挥剑

272
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,600
such as walking, running, and sword swings.

273
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,500
我们的角色在模拟环境中经过了长达 10 年的强化训练

274
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,500
Our character is put through an intense
training regimen for 10 years in simulation.

275
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:36,200
借助 NVIDIA GPU 驱动的大规模并行模拟器，这种训练在真实世界中只需花费 3 天即可完成

276
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:36,200
Thanks to NVIDIA’s massively parallel GPU simulator,
this just takes 3 days of real world time.

277
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,400
这些虚拟角色随后会学习执行各种运动技能

278
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,400
The character then learns to perform
a large variety of motor skills.

279
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,600
经过训练的虚拟角色可以利用这些技能来执行更复杂的任务

280
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,600
Once the character has been trained, it can use those skills that it has learned to perform more complex tasks.

281
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,000
现在，一个训练过的虚拟角色正跑向目标对象并将其击倒

282
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,033
Here, the character is trained to run to a
target object and knock it over.

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,500
我们还可以引导它沿着不同的方向行走，就像您操控游戏角色那样

284
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:56,500
We can also steer the character to walk in different directions like you would with a game character.

285
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,600
基于我们的模型，虚拟角色可以在新环境中自动生成自然而连贯的行为

286
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,600
Our model allows the character to automatically synthesize life-like responsive behaviors to new situations.

287
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,700
我们还可以使用自然语言控制它

288
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,733
We can also control the character
using natural language commands.

289
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,600
例如，我们可以指示角色进行盾击或者挥剑

290
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:13,633
For example, we can tell the character
to do a shield bash or swing its sword.

291
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,000
我们希望这项技术最终能让基于虚拟角色的动画制作

292
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,000
We hope this technology will eventually
make animating simulated characters

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,800
变得简单、流畅，就像和真实演员说话一样

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,800
as easy and seamless as talking to a real actor.

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
NVIDIA AI 是驱动这些创新的引擎，我们正在全力推动该平台的发展

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,033
NVIDIA AI is the engine behind these innovations, and we are all-hands-on-deck to advance the platform –

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,500
解决新问题，使其得到更广泛的应用，让 AI 触手可及

298
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:37,500
solving new problems, getting it everywhere,
and making AI more accessible.

are among the most popular libraries.

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,900
我们使用这些库来创建专用 AI 框架，包括先进的预训练模型

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,900
We use the libraries to create specialized AI frameworks
that include state-of-the-art pre-trained models

307
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,099
和数据管道，使其易于横向扩展

308
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,099
and data pipelines that make it easy to scale out.

309
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,799
我们先了解一下 GTC 大会的更新内容

310
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,799
Let me touch on a few of our updates at GTC.

311

560
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,300
then FP16, and now FP8.

561
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:23,900
在 AI 处理方面，Hopper H100 FP8 的 4 PetaFLOPS 性能是 Ampere A100 FP16 的 6 倍

562
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:23,900
For AI processing, Hopper H100’s 4 PF of FP8 is an amazing six times the performance of Ampere A100’s FP16 -

563
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,700
这是一次巨大的代际飞跃

564
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,733
our largest generational leap ever.

565
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,900
Transformer 无疑是最重要的深度学习模型

566
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:32,933
The Transformer is unquestionably the most
important deep learning model invented.

567
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Hopper 引入了 Transformer 引擎

568
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:36,900
Hopper introduces a Transformer Engine.

569
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:45,600

570
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:45,600
The Hopper Transformer Engine combines a new Tensor Core and software that uses FP8 and FP16 numerical formats,

571
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,400
动态处理 Transformer 网络的各个层

572
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,400
 and dynamically processes layers of a Transformer network.

573
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,800
Transformer 模型训练时间可从数周缩短至数天

574
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,800
Transformer model training can be reduced from weeks to days.

575
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,600
在云计算方面，多租户基础架构能够直接转化为收益和服务成本

576
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,633
For cloud computing, multi-tenant infrastructure
translates directly to revenues and cost of service.

577
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:08,700
一项服务可将 H100 划分为多达 7 个实例，Ampere 也可实现此操作

578
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:08,700
A service can partition H100 up to 7 instances –
Ampere can also do this.

579
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:16,500
但是，Hopper 新增了完整的每实例隔离和每实例 IO 虚拟化

580
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:16,500

to support multi-tenancy in the cloud.

583
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,400
H100 能够托管七个云租户，而 A100 仅能托管一个

584
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,400
H100 can host seven cloud tenants,
while A100 can only host one.

585
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:34,300
每个 H100 实例的性能相当于两个完整的 T4 GPU（我们非常热门的云推理 GPU）

586
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:34,300
Each one is equivalent in performance to two full T4 GPUs,
our most popular cloud inference GPU.

587
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,800
每个 Hopper 实例都支持在受信任执行环境中进行机密计算

588
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,800
Each Hopper multi-instance supports Confidential Computing with Trusted Execution Environment.

589
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:48,500
通常，敏感数据处于静态以及在网络中传输时会进行加密，但在使用期间却不受保护

590
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:48,500
Sensitive data is often encrypted at-rest and in-transit
over the network but unprotected during use.

591
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:55,500
此类数据可以是一个 AI 模型，依托数百万美元的投资打造而成，基于多年的领域知识

592
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Data can be an AI model that results from millions of dollars of investment, trained on years of domain knowledge or

593
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,500
或公司专有数据进行了训练，并且具有价值或机密性

594
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,533
company-proprietary data, and is valuable or secret.

595
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,700
Hopper 机密计算是处理器架构和软件的结合

596
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:04,733

of processor architecture and software,

597
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,700
能够通过保护正在使用的数据和应用，弥合这一差距

598
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:10,700
addresses this gap by protecting
both data and application during use.

599
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,200
目前，机密计算只能基于 CPU

600
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,200
Confidential Computing today is only CPU-based.

601
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Hopper 实现了首个 GPU 机密计算

602
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,033
Hopper introduces the first GPU Confidential Computing.

603
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,400
Hopper 机密计算能够保护所有者的 AI 模型和算法的机密性和完整性

604
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:26,400
Hopper Confidential Computing protects the confidentiality and integrity of AI models and algorithms of the owners.

605
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,000
软件开发者和服务提供商现可在共享或远程基础架构上分发和部署宝贵的专有 AI 模型

606
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Software developers and services can now distribute
and deploy their proprietary and valuable AI models

607
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,400
保护其知识产权并扩展业务模式

608
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,400
on shared or remote infrastructure, protecting their
intellectual property and scaling their business models.

609
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
此外，还有更多强大功能

610
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
And there’s more.

611
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:53,300
Hopper 引入了一组名为 DPX 的新指令集，旨在加速动态编程算法

612
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:53,333
Hopper introduces a new set of instructions called DPX. Designed to accelerate dynamic programming algorithms.

613
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:59,500
许多实际算法的组合复杂性或指数复杂性在不断的增长

614
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:59,533
Many real-world algorithms grow with
combinatorial or exponential complexity.

615
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,300
比如：

616
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,300
Examples include -

617
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,200
著名的旅行商优化问题

618
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,200
The famous traveling salesperson optimization problems,

619
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,200
能够进行最短路径优化，以在绘图中使用的 Floyd-Warshall 算法

620
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,200

623
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,200
还有许多图优化算法

624
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:19,233
and many graph optimization algorithms.

625
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,800
动态编程能够将复杂问题分解为可递归式解决的更简单的子问题

626
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:25,833
Dynamic programming breaks complex problems down to simpler subproblems that are solved recursively,

627
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,700
从而将复杂性和计算时间缩减至多项式计算的级别

628
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:29,700
reducing complexity and time to polynomial scale.

629
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Hopper DPX 指令集会使这些算法的速度加快多达 40 倍

630
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:35,733
Hopper DPX instructions will speed-up
these algorithms up to 40 times.

631
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,200

752
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,033
and all of our software results in a 9X speed-up!

753
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,900
计算时间从数周缩短至几天

754
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:42,900
Weeks turn to days.

755
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:50,900
在推理大型语言模型方面，H100 的吞吐量比 A100 高 30 倍

756
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:50,900
For inferencing large language models, H100 throughput
is up to 30 times higher over A100.

757
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,300
H100 是我们实现的巨大飞跃

758
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,300
H100 is the most significant leap we've ever delivered.

759
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:02,100
NVIDIA H100 是全球 AI 基础架构的新引擎

760
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:02,133
NVIDIA H100, the new engine of the world's AI infrastructure.

761
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,200
Hopper 也将成为主流系统游戏规则的改变者

762
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:06,200
Hopper is going to be a game-changer
for mainstream systems as well.

763
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,700
正如您在 Hopper HGX 和 DGX 中看到的一样，网络和互连产品对于计算至关重要

764
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,700
As you've seen with Hopper HGX and DGX, networking and interconnects are critical to computing –

765
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,800
移动数据以保持超快速的 GPU 数据馈送值得高度关注

766
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,800
moving data to keep the lightning-fast GPUs
fed is a most serious concern.

767
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,900
那么，我们如何将 Hopper 强大的计算能力引入主流服务器？

768
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,933
So, how do we bring Hopper's superfast
compute to mainstream servers?

769
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:31,500
在传统服务器中移动数据会使 CPU 和系统内存过载，并受到 PCIe 的限制

770
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:31,500
Moving data in traditional servers’ overloads CPU and
system memory and are bottlenecked by PCI-Express.

771
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,200
解决方案是将网络直接与 GPU 相连

772
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,200
The solution is to attach the network directly to the GPU.

773
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:45,600
这就是 H100 CNX，它将先进的 GPU 和强大的网络处理器 ConnectX-7

774
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:45,600
This is the H100 CNX, combining the most advanced GPU
and the most advanced networking processor, CX7,

775
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
融合至一个模组中

776
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
into a single module.

777
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:56,800
网络数据通过 DMA 以 50 GB/s 的速度直接传输至 H100，从而避免 CPU

778
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:56,800
Data from the network is DMA'd directly to H100 at 50 gigabytes per second and avoids the bottlenecks at the CPU,

779
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,200
系统内存和 PCIe 等多个通道的限制

780
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,200
system memory, and multiple passes across PCI express.

781
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:09,100
H100 CNX 能够避免带宽瓶颈，同时释放 CPU 和系统内存，以便处理应用的其他部分

782
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:09,133
H100 CNX avoids bandwidth bottlenecks while freeing the CPU and system memory to process other parts of the application.

783
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:15,300
在一个为主流服务器设计的小巧封装中包含了大量令人难以置信的技术

784
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:15,300
An incredible amount of technology in a tiny
little package designed for mainstream servers.

而且，内存带宽高达 1 TB/s，速度之快着实惊人

816
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,900
And an insane 1 terabyte per second of memory bandwidth -

817
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:54,600
是尚未发布的第 5 代顶级 CPU 的 2 到 3 倍

818
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:54,600
over two to three times the top Gen 5 CPUs
that have yet to even ship.

819
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:05,000
我们预估 Grace 超级芯片的 SPECint 2017 得分为 740，目前几乎没有任何产品可与之媲美

820
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:05,033
We estimate the Grace superchip to have a SPECint 2017
rate of 740. Nothing close to that ships today.

821
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,500
令人惊叹的是，整个模组（包括 1 TB 内存）的功率仅为 500 瓦

822
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:13,533
And the amazing thing is the entire module,
including a terabyte of memory, is only 500 Watts.

823
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,300

亲身感受这些技术对工程技术实践带来的改变

1000
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:46,500
From first-hand experience, it has transformed our engineering.

1001
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:55,000
请前往 NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud)，下载经过全栈优化并提供数据中心级加速能力的

1002

and frameworks that are full-stack optimized

1003
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,400
SDK 和框架

1004
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,400
and data-center-scale accelerated.

1005
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:10,000
当某条电线发生故障导致两个氧气罐中的一个发生爆炸时

1006
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:10,033
The Apollo 13 crew was
136,000 miles from Earth

1007
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,100
阿波罗 13 号的船员与地球相距 136000 英里

1008
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:17,100
when a faulty electrical wire caused
one of the two oxygen tanks to explode.

1009
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:22,300
NASA 在无线电中听到了至今羞于提及的一句话 –“休斯顿，我们遇到问题了。”

1010
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:22,300
And the now infamous words radioed back to NASA -
“Houston, we’ve had a problem.”

1011
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:28,400
为了“解决问题”，NASA 工程师在奥德赛号宇宙飞船的复制品上测试了氧气保存

1012
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:28,433
To “work the problem”, NASA engineers tested oxygen-preserving and power-cycling procedures

1013
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,800
和开关机循环程序

1014
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,800
on a replica of the Odyssey spacecraft.

1015
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,800
如果没有在地球上建造的全功能复制品，阿波罗 13 号将会遭受灭顶之灾

1016
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,833
Apollo 13 would have ended in disaster if not
for the fully functional replica on Earth.

1017
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,700
这是一个重要时刻

1018
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,733
This was an important moment.

1019
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:48,200
NASA 意识到了复制模拟的力量，但并非所有事物都能具有实体孪生

1020
00:51:41,733 --> 00:51:48,233
NASA realized the power of the replica,
but not everything can have a physical twin.

1021
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:57,500
因此，NASA 创造了术语“数字孪生”，用实时存在的虚拟物来表征物理实体

1022
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:57,500
So NASA coined the term “digital twin,” a living virtual representation of something physical.

1023
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:06,000
当扩展到极致时，数字孪生是一个与物理世界相连的虚拟世界

1024
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:06,033
Extended to vast scales, a digital twin is a
virtual world that’s connected to the physical world.

1025
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,900
而在互联网背景下，它带来了下一次演进

1026
00:52:06,033 --> 00:52:10,900
And in the context of the internet, it is the next evolution.

1027
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:20,600
这正是 NVIDIA Omniverse 的作用 – 数字孪生、虚拟世界以及互联网的下一次演进

1028
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:20,600
And that’s what NVIDIA Omniverse is about – digital twins, virtual worlds, and the next evolution of the internet.

1029
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:30,000
20 多年来，NVIDIA 在图形、物理学、仿真、AI 和计算技术领域深耕不辍，最终打造出 Omniverse

1030
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:30,033
Over 20 years of NVIDIA graphics, physics, simulation, AI, and computing technologies made Omniverse possible.

1031
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,800
模拟这个世界是一项终极挑战

1032
00:52:30,033 --> 00:52:33,800
Simulating the world is the ultimate grand challenge.

1033
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,500
Omniverse 是虚拟世界的仿真引擎

1034
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,533
Omniverse is a simulation engine of virtual worlds.

1035
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,400
Omniverse 世界具备物理精准的特点，并且遵守物理学定律

1036
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:42,400
Omniverse worlds are physically accurate,
obeying the laws of physics.

1037
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,900
Omniverse 在宏大的维度上运行

1038
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,933
Omniverse operates at vast scales.

1039
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,800
Omniverse 可共享，能将设计师、观看者、AI 和机器人连接起来

1040
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:50,800
And Omniverse is sharable, connecting designers,
viewers, AIs, and robots.

1041
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
那么，Omniverse 有哪些应用场景？

1042
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
But what are the applications of Omniverse?

1043
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,100
今天，我将重点介绍几个直接用例：

1044
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,100
I will highlight several immediate use-cases today.

1045
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,800
使用不同工具的设计师之间的远程协作

1046
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,800
Remote Collaboration of designers using different tools.

1047
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,700
供 AI 和机器人学习的 Sim2Real Gym

1048
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,700
Sim2Real Gyms where AI and robots learn.

1049
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,600
还有工业数字孪生

1050
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,633
And industrial Digital Twins.

1051
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,200
不过，首先让我展示一些造就 Omniverse 的基础技术

1052
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:11,200
But first, let me show you the
technologies that make Omniverse possible.

1053
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,500
Omniverse 技术将改变您的创作方式！

1054
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,500
Omniverse technology will transform the way you create!

1055
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:16,300
Omniverse 可从 RTX PC 扩展到大型系统

1056
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:16,300
Omniverse is scalable from RTX PCs to large systems.

1057
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:23,400
连接到托管 Omniverse Nucleus 的用户的 RTX PC 在性能上足以进行创意协作

1058
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:23,400
RTX PCs connected to someone hosting the Omniverse Nucleus are sufficient for creative collaboration.

1059
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,200
然而，工业数字孪生需要一种专门构建的新型计算机

1060
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,200
Industrial digital twins, however, need a new type
of purpose-built computer.

1061
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:36,700
数字孪生仿真涉及多个自主系统在同一时空内进行交互

1062
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:36,733
Digital twin simulations involve multiple autonomous systems interacting in the same space-time.

1063
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:42,800
数据中心在尽可能短的时间内而不是按照精确的时间处理数据

1064
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:42,800
Data centers process data in the
lowest possible time, not precise time.

1065
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:52,000
对于数字孪生，Omniverse 软件和计算机必须具备可扩展、低延迟和支持精确时间的特点

1066
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:52,000
So for digital twins, the Omniverse software and computer need to be scalable, low latency, and support precise time.

1067
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,800
我们需要建造同步的数据中心

1068
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,800
We need to create a synchronous data center.

1069
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,900
正如我们为 AI 提供 DGX 一样，我们现在为 Omniverse 提供 OVX

1070
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:01,933
Just as we have DGX for AI, we now have OVX for Omniverse.

1071
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:13,700
第一代 NVIDIA OVX Omniverse 计算机由
8 个 NVIDIA A40 RTX GPU、3 个 ConnectX-6 200 Gbps 网卡 (NIC)

1072
00:56:01,933 --> 00:56:13,700
The first-generation NVIDIA OVX Omniverse computer consists of eight NVIDIA A40 RTX GPUs, 3 CX6 200 Gbps NICs,

1073
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,300
和 2 个 Intel Ice Lake CPU 组成

1074
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,300
and dual Intel Ice Lake CPUs.

1075
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:28,200
利用 NVIDIA Spectrum-3 200 Gbps 交换机连接 32 台 OVX 服务器就构成了 OVX SuperPOD

1076
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:28,233
And the NVIDIA Spectrum-3 200 gigabytes per second switch fabric connects 32 OVX servers to form the OVX SuperPOD.

1077
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:34,000
最重要的是，网络和计算机使用精准时间协议进行同步

1078
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:34,000
Most importantly, the network and computers
are synchronized using Precision Timing Protocol,

1079
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,500
而且 RDMA 可更大程度降低数据包传输延迟

1080
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,533
and RDMA minimizes packet transfer latency.

1081
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,200
现在，全球各大计算机制造商纷纷推出 OVX 服务器

1082
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:41,200
OVX servers are now available from
the world’s top computer makers.

1083
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:47,500
对于想在 OVX 上试用 Omniverse 的客户，NVIDIA 在全球各地提供了 LaunchPad 计划

1084
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:47,500
And for customers wanting to try Omniverse on OVX,
NVIDIA LaunchPads are located around the world.

1085
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
第一代 OVX 正由 NVIDIA 和早期客户运行

1086
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Generation one OVX are running at NVIDIA and early customers.

1087
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,300
我们正在构建第二代 OVX – 从骨干网络开始

1088
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,333
We are building our second-generation OVX,
starting with the backbone.

1089
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,000
今天，我们宣布推出 Spectrum-4 交换机

1090
00:56:57,333 --> 00:57:01,000
Today, we are introducing the Spectrum-4 switch.

1091
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:10,400
带宽高达 51.2 Tbps 且具有 1000 亿个晶体管的 Spectrum-4 将成为非常先进的交换机

1092
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:10,400
At 51.2 terabytes per second, the 100-billion transistor Spectrum-4 is the most advanced switch ever built.

1093

同样令人兴奋的是，我可以从云、数据中心或其他任何分解系统运行

1204
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:41,000
What’s also exciting is that I can be run from the cloud,
the data center, or any other disaggregated system,

1205
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
这都要归功于 Tokkio

1206
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
all thanks to Tokkio.

1207
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,200

1210
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,700
quick-service restaurants, and even the web.

1211
01:02:51,700 --> 01:03:00,000
它使用计算机视觉、Riva 语音 AI 和 NVIDIA NeMO 等 NVIDIA AI 模型和技术打造而成

1212
01:02:51,700 --> 01:03:00,033
It comes to life using NVIDIA AI models and technology like computer vision, Riva speech AI, and NVIDIA NeMO.

1213
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,900
而且，由于 Tokkio 在我们的统一计算框架（或 UCF）上运行，因此可以从云端横向扩展

1214
01:03:00,033 --> 01:03:05,933
And because it runs on our unified computing framework,
or UCF, Tokkio can scale-out from the cloud

1215
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:09,300
当客户需要像我一样实用的虚拟形象时，满足他们的需求

1216
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:09,333
and go wherever customers need helpful avatars like me,

1217
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,600
并且 Tokkio 具有非常敏锐且响应灵敏的感知力，最重要的是，非常自然

1218
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:13,633
with senses that are fully acute
and responsive, and above all, natural.

如今的 AI 以感知和模式识别为中心，例如图像识别、语音理解

1222
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:27,800
Today’s AI centers around perception and pattern recognition, like recognizing an image, understanding speech,

1223
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,400
推荐视频节目或商品

1224
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,433

and Holoscan for robotic medical instruments.

1233
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:06,200
正如 NASA 认识到的，我们需要数字孪生来操作远处的机器人舰队

1234
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:06,233
And just as NASA recognized, we will need digital twins in order to operate fleets of robots that are far away.

1235
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:12,700
机器人系统的工作流程很复杂。我将它简化为四个支柱：

1236
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:12,700
The workflow of a robotic system is complex.
I’ve simplified it here to four pillars:

1237
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,900
收集和生成真值数据；

1238
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,900
Collecting and generating ground truth data,

1239
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,900
创建 AI 模型；

1240
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,933
creating the AI model,

1241
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,600
使用数字孪生进行仿真；

1242
01:04:17,933 --> 01:04:20,633
simulating with a digital twin,

1243
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,700

1335
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,700
从而进一步增强安全性并扩大全自动驾驶的工作领域

1336
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,700
further enhancing safety and extending the
operating domains of full self-driving.

1337
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:28,800
NVIDIA DRIVE Map 是一种多模态地图引擎，包括摄像头、雷达和激光雷达的数据

1338
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:28,832
NVIDIA DRIVE Map is a multi-modal map engine
and includes camera, radar, and lidar.

1339
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:35,200
您可以单独定位到地图的每一层，这将提供多样性和冗余性

1340
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:35,232
You can localize to each layer of the map independently,
which provides diversity and redundancy

1341
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,399
以实现最高级别的安全性

1342
01:09:35,233 --> 01:09:37,399
for the highest level of safety.

1343
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:45,299
Drive Map 有两个地图引擎：真值测绘地图和众包车队地图

1344
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:45,332
Drive Map has two map engines – ground truth survey mapping and crowdsourced fleet mapping.

1345
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:54,400
到 2024 年底，我们预计绘制并创建北美、西欧和亚洲所有主要公路的数字孪生

1346
01:09:45,332 --> 01:09:54,433
By the end of 2024, we expect to map and create a digital twin of all major highways in North America, Western Europe,

1347
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,000
– 总长度约为 50 万公里

1348
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:59,000
and Asia – about 500,000 kilometers.

1349
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,600
数百万辆乘用车将不断扩展和更新该地图

1350
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,600
The map will be expanded and updated
by millions of passenger cars.

1351
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:11,300
我们正在构建地球级别的自动驾驶车队数字孪生，以探索新的算法和设计

1352
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:11,300
We are building an earth-scale digital twin of our AV fleet
to explore new algorithms and designs,

1353
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,000
并在部署到车队之前测试软件

1354
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,033
and test software before deploying to the fleet.

1355
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,100
我们正在开发两种场景仿真方法，每种都以不同方式重建整个世界

1356
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:21,100
We are developing two methods to simulate scenarios – each reconstructs the world in different ways.

1357
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:26,200
其中一种方法从 NVIDIA Drive Map 开始，这种多模态地图引擎

1358
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:26,200
One method starts from NVIDIA Drive Map,
a multi-modal map engine

1359
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,100
可为整个世界创建高度精确的 3D 表现形式

1360
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,133
that creates a highly accurate 3D representation of the world.

1361
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,100
地图加载到 Omniverse 中

1362
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:34,133
The map is loaded into Omniverse.

1363
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,800
建筑、植被和其他路边目标均会生成

1364
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,800
Buildings, vegetation, and
other roadside objects are generated.

1365
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:54,300
系统对之前驾驶过程中遇到的运动目标、汽车和行人进行推理和定位

1366
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:54,300
From previous drives, the dynamic objects, cars, and pedestrians, are inferred, localized,

1367
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,700
然后放入数字孪生中

1368
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,700
and placed into the digital twin.

1369
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:09,200
我们可以将每个运动目标生成动画，或向其分配 AI 行为模型

1370
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:09,233
Each dynamic object can be animated or
assigned an AI behavior model.

1371
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:19,700
还可以应用域随机化来生成多样化且合理的挑战性场景

1372
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:19,733
Domain randomization can be applied to generate
diverse and plausible challenging scenarios.

1373
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:34,100
第二种方法使用神经图形 AI 和 Omniverse，将预先录制的驾驶视频

1374
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:34,133
A second approach uses Neural Graphics AI and
Omniverse to transform a pre-recorded drive video

1375
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:38,200
转换为可回放和可修改的驾驶过程

1376
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:38,200
into a reenactable and modifiable drive.

1377
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,800
我们首先重建 3D 场景

1378
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,800
We start by reconstructing the scene in 3D.

1379
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,700
系统会识别并移除运动的目标，背景被恢复

1380
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,733
Dynamic objects are recognized and removed,
and the background is restored.

1381
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:51,900
重建场景后，我们可以改变现有车辆的行为

1382
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:51,933
After scene reconstruction, we can
change the behavior of existing vehicles

1383
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:57,000
或添加可完全控制、在交通环境下真实反应的车辆

1384
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:57,000
or add fully controllable vehicles
that behave realistically to traffic.

1385
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:05,100
重新生成的驾驶过程，结合 3D 几何图形和基于物理效果的材质，让我们可以为场景重新打光

1386
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:05,133
The regenerated drive, with 3D geometry, and physically based materials, allow us to properly re-illuminate the scene,

1387
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,100
应用物理效果和仿真激光雷达等传感器

1388
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:09,133
apply physics, and simulate sensors, like LIDAR.

1389
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:16,300
现在，可以重新运行预先录制的场景，并运用于闭环仿真和测试

1390
01:12:09,133 --> 01:12:16,300
The pre-recorded scene is now reenactable and can be
used for closed-loop simulation and testing.

1391
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:24,300
DRIVE Map 和 DRIVE Sim 包含 NVIDIA 研究工作取得的突破性 AI 成果，
展示了 Omniverse 数字孪生

1392
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:24,300
DRIVE Map and DRIVE Sim, with AI breakthroughs by NVIDIA research, showcase the power of Omniverse digital twin

1393
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,400
在推动自动驾驶汽车开发方面的力量

1394
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,433
to advance the development of autonomous vehicles.

1395
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:38,200
NVIDIA DRIVE Map、DRIVE Sim、搭载 Orin 的 Hyperion 8 和 DRIVE AV 栈

1396
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:38,200
NVIDIA DRIVE Map, DRIVE Sim,
Hyperion 8 with Orin, and DRIVE AV stacks

1397
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,900
既可单独使用，也可作为一个整体使用

1398
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,900
are available independently or together as a whole.

1399
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,200
电动汽车已促使业界对汽车架构进行彻底的重新设计

1400
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,200
Electric vehicles have forced a
complete redesign of car architectures.

1401
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:54,500
未来的汽车将高度可编程，从内置许多嵌入式控制器发展为高度集中式的计算平台

1402
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:54,500
Future cars will be highly programmable, evolving from many embedded controllers to highly centralized computers.

1403
01:12:54,500 --> 01:13:01,200
AI 和自动驾驶功能将在软件中提供，并在汽车生命周期内不断增强

1404
01:12:54,500 --> 01:13:01,200
The AI and AV functionalities will be delivered in
software and enhanced for the life of the car.

1405
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:06,500
NVIDIA Orin 携手多家公司共同打造这样的未来，已经取得巨大成功

1406
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:06,500
NVIDIA Orin has been enormously
successful with companies building this future.

1407
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:14,600
Orin 是理想的集中式自动驾驶和 AI 计算平台，也是新一代电动汽车

1408
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:14,600
Orin is the ideal centralized AV and AI computer
and is the engine of new-generation EVs,

1409
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,500
无人驾驶出租车、公共汽车和卡车的引擎

1410
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,500
robotaxis, shuttles, and trucks.

1411
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,800
Orin 本月开始发售

1412
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,800
Orin started shipping this month.

1413
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:28,600
今天，我们很高兴地宣布，全球第二大电动汽车制造商比亚迪

1414
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:28,600
Today we are thrilled to announce that BYD,
the second-largest EV maker globally,

1415
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:36,100
将为 2023 年上半年开始投产的汽车搭载 DRIVE Orin 计算平台

1416
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:36,100
will adopt the DRIVE Orin computer for cars
starting production in the first half of 2023.

1417
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:42,400
NVIDIA 自动驾驶车载计算机、软件和机器人 AI 基本上

1418
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:42,400
NVIDIA’s self-driving car computer, software,
and robotics AI is essentially

1419
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,800
是与新一代医疗系统相同的计算管线

1420
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,800
 the same computing pipeline as
next-generation medical systems.

1421
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:54,300
请允许我为大家展示 Holoscan 可以为一台名为光片显微镜的惊人仪器做些什么

1422
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:54,300
Let me show you what Holoscan can do for an incredible instrument called a lightsheet microscope.

1423
01:13:54,300 --> 01:14:01,600
光片显微镜由诺贝尔奖得主 Eric Betzig 发明，可利用高分辨率荧光

1424
01:13:54,300 --> 01:14:01,633
Invented by Nobel laureate Eric Betzig,
lightsheet microscopes use high-resolution fluorescence

1425
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:09,200
创建细胞移动和分裂的影片，使得研究人员能够研究运动中的生物学

1426
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:09,200
to create a movie of cells moving and dividing, giving researchers the ability to study biology in motion.

1427
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:22,100
问题在于光片显微镜每小时可产生 3TB 的数据，这相当于 30 部 4K 电影的数据量

1428
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:22,100
The problem is that lightsheet microscopes produce 3TB
of data per hour – the equivalent of 30 4K movies.

1429
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:26,100
处理 3TB 的数据需要长达一天的时间

1430
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:26,100
It takes up to a day to process the 3TB of data.

1431
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:32,000
借助 NVIDIA Clara Holoscan，我们可以对这些数据进行实时处理

1432
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:32,000
With NVIDIA Clara Holoscan,
we can process the data in real-time.

1433
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:41,300
现在，借助 Clara Holoscan 和 NVIDIA Index，我们可以实时可视化大量活细胞

1434
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:41,333
Now with Clara Holoscan and NVIDIA index we can
visualize the entire large volume of living cells in real time

1435
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:45,000
这些数据是直接从显微镜记录下来的

1436
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:45,000
as the data is being recorded directly from the microscope.

1437
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,500
通过观察这些活的癌细胞的移动情况，我们可以同时看到正常、健康的生物特征

1438
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,533
Watching these living cancer cells move about,
we can see normal healthy biology

1439
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,400
及其恶化过程

1440
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:52,400
and maligent processes at the same time.

1441
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:59,300
蓝色荧光标记的细胞核从一个细胞分裂为两个细胞

1442
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:59,300
The fluorescent marker rendered in blue marks nuclei,
which we see splitting to form two cells from one cell.

1443
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:06,500
癌症的一个标志是，与正常的健康细胞相比，细胞分裂更频繁，错误检查更少

1444
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:06,533
A hallmark of cancer is cell division occurring more frequently and with less error checking than normal, healthy cells.

1445
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,700
加州大学伯克利分校的晶格光片显微镜具有超高分辨率

1446
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:10,733
Using Berkeley’s lattice light sheet microscope,
the ultimate-high resolution

1447
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:16,700
借此科学家能够发现隐藏在普通光学器件中的东西，这是 使用传统显微镜无法观察到的

1448
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:16,733
allows scientists to see what is hidden to normal light optics – not seen using traditional microscopes.

1449
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:23,400
当我们放大时，观察到一个对于癌细胞系来说都非常罕见的情况 –

1450
01:15:16,733 --> 01:15:23,433
As we zoom in, watch cancer cells display what is thought to be a rare event even for cancer cell lines –

1451
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,200
发现一个细胞分裂成 3 个细胞

1452
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:26,233
see one cell split into 3 cells.

1453
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:32,500
这一现象仅在一些科学出版物中有过零星报道

1454
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:32,500
This phenomenon has only been reported
anecdotally in a couple of scientific publications.

1455
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:39,400
科学家尚不知道我们将看到什么，但现在借助实时处理和可视化技术

1456
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:39,400
Scientists do not yet know what we will see – but this technique, enabled with real-time processing and visualization,

1457
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:44,600
科学界可以发现此类的未见过的事件

1458
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:44,600
now allows the scientific community
to discover new unseen events like this.

1459
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,400
我们来看看未来的发展情况

1460
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,400
Let’s see what the future has in store.

1461
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:52,800

1473
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,300
未来的医疗设备将是 AI 仪器的天下，用于辅助诊断或手术

1474
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:30,300
Future medical devices will be AI instruments,
assisting diagnostics or surgery.

1475
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:40,000
正如 NVIDIA DRIVE 是机器人车辆平台一样，Clara Holoscan 也是一个机器人医疗仪器平台

1476
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:40,000
Just as NVIDIA DRIVE is a platform for robotic vehicles, Clara Holoscan is a platform for robotic medical instruments.

1477

对机器人和自动化的需求正呈指数级增长

1482
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,933
The demand for robotics and
automation is increasing exponentially.

1483
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:58,000
一些机器人会移动，而其他机器人则会观察移动的目标

1484
01:16:52,933 --> 01:16:58,000
Some robots move, and other robots watch things that move.

1485
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,700
NVIDIA 与数千客户和开发者合作构建机器人，广泛用于制造、零售、医疗健康

01:17:05,733 --> 01:17:10,900
agriculture, construction, airports, and entire cities.

1489
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:15,700
NVIDIA 的机器人平台由 Metropolis 和 Isaac 组成 –

1490
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:15,733
NVIDIA’s robotics platforms consist of Metropolis and Isaac –

1491
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:19,400

Metropolis 和 Isaac 平台（如同 DRIVE）包含 4 大核心：真值生成、AI 模型训练

1496
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:34,300
Metropolis and Isaac platforms, like DRIVE, consist of 4 pillars – Ground Truth generation, AI model training,

1497
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:40,900
Omniverse 数字孪生，以及配备了软件和计算机的机器人

1498
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:40,900
Omniverse digital twin, and the robot with
robotic software and computer.

1499

现在，客户可以使用 Omniverse 创建其架构的数字孪生，以提升安全性和效率

1506
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:13,300
And now, customers can use Omniverse to create digital twins of their facilities to drive better safety and efficiency.

1507
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:18,100
我们来看看百事公司是如何使用 Metropolis 和 Omniverse 的

1508
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:18,133
Let’s take a look at how the Pepsi company
is using Metropolis and Omniverse.

1509
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:21,600
百事的产品每天在全球有超过 10 亿次的消费

1510
01:18:18,133 --> 01:18:21,600
PepsiCo’s products are enjoyed
1B times a day around the world.

1511
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,600
将如此多的产品分销至 200 多个区域市场需要 600 多个配送中心

1512
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,633
Getting this many products to their 200 regional markets requires over 600 distribution centers.

1513
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,400
提高供应链效率和环境可持续性是百事一直以来的重要目标

1514
01:18:27,633 --> 01:18:33,400
Improving the efficiency and environmental sustainability of their supply chain is a key goal for Pepsi Co.

1515
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,700
为实现这一目标，他们采用 NVIDIA Omniverse 和 Metropolis 构建数字孪生

1516
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,700
To achieve this, they are building digital twins to
simulate their packaging and distribution centers

1517
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,400
模拟包装和配送中心

1518
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,400
using NVIDIA Omniverse and Metropolis.

1519
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,000
这样他们能够在进行实物投资之前测试布局变化

1520
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,000
This allows them to test variations in layout
and optimize workflows to accelerate throughput

1521
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,300
优化工作流程以加速吞吐量

1522
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,300
before making any physical investments.

1523
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:52,300
随着新产品和流程的推出，可以使用 Omniverse Replicator 和 NVIDIA TAO

1524
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:52,333
As new products and processes are introduced, Omniverse Replicator and NVIDIA TAO can be used to create

1525
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:57,200
创建逼真的合成数据，然后重新训练实时 AI 模型

1526
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:57,233
photorealistic synthetic data to re-train the real-time AI models.

1527
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,500
这些新模型和优化被转移到现实世界

1528
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:01,500
These updated models and optimizations
are then transferred to the physical world.

1529
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:06,500
通过 NVIDIA Metropolis 应用（使用 AI 计算机视觉）实时监控和优化传送带速度

1530
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:06,500
From here, NVIDIA Metropolis applications monitor
and adjust conveyer belt speed in real-time

1531
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:12,700
防止在长达数英里的传送带上发生堵塞和宕机

1532
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:12,700
using AI enabled computer vision helping prevent
congestion and downtime across miles of conveyor belts.

1533
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:17,000
此外，借助 NVIDIA Fleet Command，所有这些应用均可从一个集中式控制平面

1534
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:17,000
What’s more, with NVIDIA Fleet Command,
all these applications can be securely deployed

1535
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,100
安全部署于数百个配送中心并进行管理

1536
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,100
and managed across hundreds of
distribution centers from one central plane.

1537
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:27,000
通过利用 NVIDIA Omniverse、Metropolis 和 Fleet Command，
百事公司正在简化供应链运营

1538
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:27,000
By leveraging NVIDIA Omniverse, Metropolis, and Fleet Command, PepsiCo is streamlining supply chain operations,

1539
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,500

1540
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,500
reducing energy usage, and advancing
their mission towards sustainability.

1541
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:41,900
机器人发展最快的领域之一是自主移动机器人 (AMR)

1542
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:41,900
One of the fastest-growing segments of robotics is AMR – autonomous mobile robots –

1543
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,200
本质上是室内的无人驾驶车

1544
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,200
essentially driverless cars for indoors.

1545
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,300
速度较低，但环境高度非结构化

1546
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,333
The speed is lower, but the environment is highly unstructured.

1547
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:53,500
目前有数千万个工厂、商店和餐厅

1548
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:53,500
There are 10’s of millions of factories, stores, and restaurants.

1549
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:59,000
以及面积达数亿平方英尺的仓储和运营中心

1550
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:59,000
And 100’s of millions of square feet of
warehouse and fulfillment centers.

1551
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,600
今天，我们将发布 Isaac 的一个重要版本，即 Isaac for AMR

1552

最后，Omniverse 可支持构建 Isaac Replicator（用于生成合成数据）

1590
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:08,700
Finally, Omniverse is used to build
Isaac Replicator for synthetic data generation,

1591
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:14,400
Isaac Gym（用于训练机器人），以及 Isaac Sim（用于数字孪生）

1592
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:14,400
Isaac Gym to train robots, and Isaac Sim for digital twins.

1593
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,600
Isaac 开发流程全程集成了 Omniverse

1594
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,600
The Isaac development flow integrates Omniverse throughout.

1596
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,833
Isaac Gym highlights the importance of
Omniverse’s physics simulation accuracy.

1597
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:31,100
在 Isaac Gym 中，一个新机器人通过使用深度强化学习执行数千到数百万次学习

1598
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:31,133
In Isaac Gym, a new robot learns a new skill
by performing it thousands to millions of times

1599
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,600
来掌握一项新技能

1600
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:33,600
using deep reinforcement learning.

1601
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:42,700
然后，经过训练的 AI 大脑被下载到物理机器人中。由于 Omniverse在物理上是精确的，因此机器人

1602
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:42,700
The trained AI brain is then downloaded into the physical robot. And since Omniverse is physically accurate, the robot,

1603
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:48,500
在获得其方位后，将掌握其在数字孪生中的技能

1604
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:48,500
after getting its bearings,
should adopt the skills of its digital twin.

1605
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,800
一起来看一下

1606
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,800
Let’s take a look.

1607
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:55,400
成功开发、训练和测试适用于现实世界应用的复杂机器人

1608
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:55,400
Successful development, training, and testing of
complex robots for real-world applications

1609
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,100
需要高保真仿真和准确的物理效果

1610
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,100
demand high-fidelity simulation and accurate physics.

1611
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:06,000
Isaac Sim 基于 NVIDIA 的 Omniverse 平台构建，将沉浸式虚拟现实的、物理属性准确的、逼真的环境

1612
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:06,000
Built on NVIDIA's Omniverse platform, Isaac Sim combines immersive, physically accurate, photorealistic environments

1613
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,700
与复杂的虚拟机器人相结合

1614
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,700
with complex virtual robots.

1615
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:15,000
我们来看看合作伙伴使用 Isaac Sim 开发的三种截然不同的 AI 机器人

1616
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:15,033
Let’s look at three very different AI-based robots being developed by our partners using Isaac Sim.

1617
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:22,800
Fraunhofer IML 是物流领域的技术领导者，使用 NVIDIA Isaac Sim 来虚拟开发 Obelix

1618
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:22,800
Fraunhofer IML, a technology leader in logistics, uses NVIDIA Isaac Sim for the virtual development of Obelix—

1619
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,900
这是一种高度动态的室内/室外自主移动机器人 (AMR)

1620
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,933
a highly dynamic indoor/outdoor
Autonomous Mobile Robot, or AMR.

1621
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:32,900
从 CAD 导入逾 5400 个零件并借助 Omniverse PhysX 进行装配后

1622
01:23:27,933 --> 01:23:32,933
After importing over 5400 parts from CAD
and rigging with Omniverse PhysX,

1623
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:38,100
虚拟机器人在仿真环境中的移动与在现实世界中一样灵巧

1624
01:23:32,933 --> 01:23:38,100
the virtual robot moves just as deftly in
simulation as it does in the real world.

1625
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:44,000
这不仅可加快虚拟开发速度，还能够扩展至更大的场景

1626
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:44,000
This not only accelerates virtual development,
but also enables scaling to larger scenarios.

1627
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
接下来要介绍的是以工业自动化闻名的 Festo。该公司使用 Isaac Sim

1628
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Next, Festo, well known for industrial automation,
uses Isaac Sim to develop intelligent skills

1629
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,300
为协作机器人（简称 cobot）开发智能技能，需要对其人类伙伴和任务有敏锐的认识

1630
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,300
for collaborative robots, or cobots, requiring acute awareness of their environment, human partners, and tasks.

1631
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:03,900
使用 Cortex（一款 Isaac Sim 工具），Festo 可显著简化 cobot 技能的编程

1632
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:03,900
Festo uses Cortex, an Isaac Sim tool that
dramatically simplifies programming cobot skills.

1633
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:11,500
为实现感知，此任务中使用的 AI 模型仅使用由 Isaac Replicator 生成的合成数据进行训练

1634
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:11,500
For perception, AI models used in this task were trained using only synthetic data generated by Isaac Replicator.

1635
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:19,200
最后，要为您介绍机器狗 Anymal，
由苏黎世联邦理工学院（ETH Zurich）和 Swiss-Mile 的一个领先的机器人研究小组开发

1636
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:19,233
Finally, there is Anymal, a robot dog developed by a leading robotics research group from ETH Zurich and Swiss-Mile.

1637
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:25,100
借助 GPU 加速的端到端强化学习，Anymal 的脚被轮子取代

1638
01:24:19,233 --> 01:24:25,133
Using end-to-end GPU accelerated Reinforcement Learning, Anymal, whose feet were replaced with wheels,

1639
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:31,100
然后使用 NVIDIA 的 Isaac Gym 训练工具，
只需几分钟就可学会在城市地形上“行走”，而无需花费几周时间

1640
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:31,100
learned to 'walk' over urban terrain within minutes rather
than weeks using NVIDIA's Isaac Gym training tool.

1641
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:36,500
运动策略在 Isaac Sim 中进行验证后，才会部署在真实的 Anymal 上

1642
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:36,500
The locomotion policy was verified in
Isaac Sim and deployed on a real Anymal.

1643
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:41,300
这是一个针对真实部署进行的引人入胜的模拟器训练演示

1644
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:41,300
This is a compelling demonstration of
simulator training for real-world-deployment.

1645
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:47,800
从训练感知和策略到硬件在环，Isaac Sim 工具可构建 AI 机器人

1646
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:47,833
From training perception and policies to hardware-in-loop,
Isaac Sim is the tool to build AI-based robots

1647
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:53,000
这些机器人在仿真中诞生，在现实世界中工作（娱乐）

1648
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:53,000
that are born in simulation to work and play in the real-world.

1649
01:24:54,100 --> 01:25:03,700
现代仓储运营中心正在演变为技术奇迹，设备由人类和机器人协同操作

1650
01:24:54,100 --> 01:25:03,733
Modern fulfillment centers are evolving into technical marvels – facilities operated by humans and robots working together.

1651
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:13,000
仓库也是一个机器人，负责协调内部物料的运输和 AMR 的路径优化

1652
01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:13,033
The warehouse is also a robot, orchestrating the flow of materials and the route plans of the AMRs inside.

1653
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,600
我们来看看 Amazon 如何使用 Omniverse 数字孪生技术

1654
01:25:13,033 --> 01:25:16,600
Let’s look at how Amazon uses Omniverse digital twin

1655
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:21,500
来设计和优化令人惊叹的仓储运营中心

1656
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:21,500
to design and optimize their incredible
fulfillment center operations.

1657
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,900
每一天，亚马逊的数百个运营中心需处理数千万个包裹

1658
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,900
Every day, hundreds of Amazon’s facilities
handle tens of millions of packages,

1659
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:30,800
而其中超过三分之二的客户订单由机器人处理

1660
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:30,800
with more than two thirds of these
customer orders handled by robots.

1661
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:36,200
为了支持这种高度复杂的操作，我们部署了数十万个自主移动机器人

1662
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:36,200
To support this highly complex operation,
we deployed hundreds of thousands mobile drive robots,

1663
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,100
和相关的存储舱

1664
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,100
and associated storage pods,

1665
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:42,300
这使我们能够在仓库中存储远高于传统货架的库存

1666
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:42,300
which allow us to store far more inventory
in our buildings than traditional shelving.

1667
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,500
这帮助我们以更安全、更高效的方式移动库存

1668
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,500
And which help us move inventory in a safer, more efficient way.

1669
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,800
扩展的关键在于我们模拟这些建筑的能力

1670
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,800
Key to the scaling has been our
ability to simulate these buildings

1671
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,100
以及在构建之前了解它们的性能

1672
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,133
and understand their performance before we build them.

1673
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:59,900
我们来看看 NVIDIA Omniverse 如何助力优化和简化这些复杂的流程

1674
01:25:53,133 --> 01:25:59,900
Let’s look at how NVIDIA Omniverse is helping us
optimize and simplify these processes.

1675
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:06,900
在 Amazon Robotics，我们可以在 NVIDIA Omniverse 中创建相同比例的仓库“数字孪生”

1676
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:06,900
At Amazon Robotics, we are able create full-scale “digital twins” of our warehouses in NVIDIA Omniverse,

1677
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:14,000
帮助我们优化仓库设计、训练更智能的机器人助手，并提升运营效率

1678
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:14,000
helping us optimize warehouse design, train more intelligent robot assistants, and gain operational efficiencies.

1679
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,400
在 Omniverse 中，我们能够以特有的方式整合来自不同 CAD 应用的数据集

1680
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,433
In Omniverse, we are uniquely able to aggregate
datasets from many different CAD applications

1681
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:23,100
并在 Omniverse 的 RTX 加速光线追踪、材质和物理效果的推动下

1682
01:26:19,433 --> 01:26:23,133
and visualize these massive models in full-fidelity realism,

1683
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:29,700
高度真实地呈现这些大型模型

1684
01:26:23,133 --> 01:26:29,700
enabled by Omniverse's RTX-accelerated
ray tracing, materials, and physics.

1685
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:33,300
数字孪生是未来仓库和工厂不可或缺的组成部分

1686
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:33,300
Digital twins are an integral part of
future warehouses and factories,

1687
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:37,100
可实现持续集成和交付

1688
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:37,100
enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery.

1689
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,500
对于软件和仓库布局的每一次新优化

1690
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,533
With each new software and layout optimization,

1691
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:43,400
我们都可以先在数字孪生中进行测试，然后再发布至物理仓库

1692
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:43,433
we can test in the digital twin before
releasing to the physical warehouse,

1693
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:48,700
这样既可防止系统停机或故障，也可最大限度地提高运营效率

1694
01:26:43,433 --> 01:26:48,733
preventing system downtime or failure
while maximizing operational efficiencies.

1695
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:56,200
然后，各种形状、尺寸、重量和材质的包裹都可以在我们的仓储中心迅速移动

1696
01:26:48,733 --> 01:26:56,233
Next, packages of every shape, size, weight, and material
move rapidly through our fulfillment centers.

1697
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:02,100
我们使用 NVIDIA Omniverse 更好地训练自主机器人分类和拣选解决方案

1698
01:26:56,233 --> 01:27:02,100
We use NVIDIA Omniverse to better train
autonomous robotic sorting and picking solutions.

1699
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:07,300
训练这些机器人的感知系统以使其具有足够的准确性以避免系统故障

1700
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:07,300
Training these robots' perception systems
accurately enough to prevent system failures

1701
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:14,700
需要大量高质量的数据，但通常可能没有数据或者数据量不够

1702
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:14,700
requires massive amounts of high-quality data, but often,
the data doesn't exist, or there isn't enough.

1703
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:20,500
当我们的包装材料中包含很多反光胶带时，感知系统会失误

1704
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:20,500
When we introduced more reflective tape to our packing materials, the perception systems failed.

1705
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:26,200
我们使用在 Omniverse 中生成的物理属性准确、逼真的合成数据以重新训练模型

1706
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:26,233
We retrained the models with physically accurate, photoreal synthetic data generated in Omniverse -

1707
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:33,500
这些数据与真实数据别无二致，从而可以节省数周的重新训练时间，并提高模型准确性

1708
01:27:26,233 --> 01:27:33,500
indistinguishable from reality - saving weeks of
retraining time and increasing model accuracy.

1709
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:40,400
最后，借助我们运营中心的数字孪生，以及快速、准确训练机器人感知系统的能力

1710
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:40,400
Finally, with digital twins of our facilities and the ability to quickly and accurately train robot perception systems

1711
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:48,000
我们还可以更好地配置人机工作站，更好地模拟人体工程学

1712
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:48,000
we can also better configure human-robot workstations, simulating opportunities for better employee ergonomics.

1713
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:54,700
亚马逊正借助 NVIDIA Omniverse 数字孪生端到端地重塑仓库物流

1714

我们来看看这有多么简单

1736
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,533
Let’s take a look at how easy it works.

1737
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:13,500
3D 设计是一项复杂的团队工作，涉及不同的艺术家、应用和硬件，且工作地点通常各不相同

1738
01:29:06,733 --> 01:29:13,500
3D design is a complex team sport, with different artists, apps and hardware, often working in different locations.

1739
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,900
借助 Omniverse Cloud，这将变得更加简单

1740
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,900
With Omniverse Cloud, it’s much easier.

1741
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:23,100
使用 NVIDIA RTX PC、笔记本电脑和工作站，设计师可实时协同工作

1742
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:23,133
Using NVIDIA RTX PCs, laptops, and workstations,

1746
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:35,300
Let's watch as an architectural design team reviews a project using Omniverse View in a web conference.

1747
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,700
好的，这里是 5 楼的露台

1748
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,700
Alright, right here is the 5th floor patio.

1749
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,400
为了更好地感受光照，我们来看看中午时候这个地方的样子

1750
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,433
To get a better feel for the lighting,
let’s see what this space looks like at noon.

1751
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,400
好的！

1752
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,433
Sure!

1753
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:53,400
嗯，有一点阳光了。我们来对棚架进行一些调整

1754
01:29:48,433 --> 01:29:53,400
Hmm... it’s a little sunny.
Let’s make some adjustments to the trellis.

1755
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,700
稍等

1756
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,733
One sec…

1757
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,800
现在如何？

1758
01:29:55,733 --> 01:29:56,800
How’s that?

1759
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,700

How does this look?

1781
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,500
很赞！但我们可以让树木呈现更多差异吗？比如大小和种类？

1782
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,500
Nice!... but TJ can we vary the trees, say size and type?

1783
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,000
好，就是这样

1784
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,033
OK, here you go.

1785
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,900
嗨，TJ，我们到吧台来看看晚上的效果

1786
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:43,933
Hey TJ, let's go to the bar
and see what it looks like at night.

1787
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,600
就是这样

1788
01:30:43,933 --> 01:30:45,600
You got it!

1789
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,400
